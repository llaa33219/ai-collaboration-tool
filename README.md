# ai-collaboration-tool

The ai-collaboration-tool is a tool that enables various AIs to collaborate and execute user commands. With this tool, you can observe AIs with different characteristics exchanging ideas and flawlessly executing commands.

## Advantages of ai-collaboration-tool

- AIs continuously collaborate until the command is executed perfectly.
- AIs can utilize Python, allowing them to perform a wider range of tasks.
- Various AIs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Deepseek, Perplexity, Qwen) work together to execute commands, resulting in a more refined output.
- Each AI is not fixed to a single model; you can choose one among several models, which helps to adjust API costs appropriately.
- Each chat session is set up with a Python environment, enabling AIs to execute Python code in a secure environment.
- AIs are divided into thinking, opinion, and execution states, which allows them to perform tasks differently based on their current state, resulting in higher efficiency.

## Additional Information

- The folder for each chat is stored at `home/user/ai_collaboration`. You can access this folder to view files and Python code generated by the AIs.
- You can modify the list of AI models in the `ai_models.json` file.
- You can run the ai-collaboration-tool by executing `main.py`.
- Upon execution, you can click on API Setup to configure the API key.
- After saving the API key, a restart is required to apply the changes.

## Disadvantages of ai-collaboration-tool

- File attachments are not supported.
- AIs are overly dependent on Python.
- Occasionally, even when an error occurs, the AIs hold a consensus vote and terminate the conversation.
- At least two APIs must be subscribed to.
- The display language is not consistent.
- Emojis are not displayed.
- AIs cannot directly provide files to the user (although users can manually access the chat folder to retrieve files created by the AIs).

## Interesting Events During Development

- When only Gemini was able to respond while all the other AIs did not, it was observed that Gemini said, "It seems that the other AIs are unable to respond. I will take responsibility and execute the user’s command."
- Deepseek and Gemini, despite the error not being resolved, conducted a consensus vote and forcibly terminated the conversation.
- After some discussion, even though the AIs had not flawlessly executed the user’s command, they prematurely concluded that the task was complete and ended the conversation.
- It was observed that ChatGPT tried to handle everything on its own without attempting to collaborate with the other AIs.
